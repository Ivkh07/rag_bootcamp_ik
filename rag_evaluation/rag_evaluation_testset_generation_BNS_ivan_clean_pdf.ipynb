    "# RAG Evaluation Test Set Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to use the [Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/) (```v 0.1.22```) framework to generate a **test set** that can be used to evaluate the quality of a RAG pipeline. We then use the Python [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) library to run some requests through this pipeline and we evaluate the quality of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u>Requirements</u>\n",
    "1. As you will accessing the LLMs and embedding models through Vector AI Engineering's Kaleidoscope Service (Vector Inference + Autoscaling), you will need to request a KScope API Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "      Run the following command (replace ```<user_id>``` and ```<password>```) from **within the cluster** to obtain the API Key. The ```access_token``` in the output is your KScope API Key.\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  curl -X POST -d \"grant_type=password\" -d \"username=<user_id>\" -d \"password=<password>\" https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/token\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "2. After obtaining the `.env` configurations, make sure to create the ```.kscope.env``` file in your home directory (```/h/<user_id>```) and set the following env variables:\n",
    "- For local models through Kaleidoscope (KScope):\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    export OPENAI_BASE_URL=\"https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/v1\"\n",
    "    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<kscope_api_key>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- For OpenAI models:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   export OPENAI_BASE_URL=\"https://api.openai.com/v1\"\n",
    "   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai_api_key>\n",

High fuel costs limit profit and push companies to raise transportation rates to compensate. However, the industry's competitive nature prevents businesses from fully passing costs downstream, forcing them to absorb parts of the cost. This is particularly true for general freight truckers who don't enjoy the same pricing power as specialized truckers, such as those who transport reefers, dry vans, and oil tankers. Surcharges allow truckers to pass rising fuel costs downstream to their clients, but the competitive pricing landscape prevents them from fully benefiting from fuel spikes. As a result, rising fuel prices have halted profit expansion and pressured tankers and reefers, although less than general freight truckers.\n",
