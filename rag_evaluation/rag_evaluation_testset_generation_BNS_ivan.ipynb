    "# RAG Evaluation Test Set Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to use the [Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/) (```v 0.1.22```) framework to generate a **test set** that can be used to evaluate the quality of a RAG pipeline. We then use the Python [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) library to run some requests through this pipeline and we evaluate the quality of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u>Requirements</u>\n",
    "1. As you will accessing the LLMs and embedding models through Vector AI Engineering's Kaleidoscope Service (Vector Inference + Autoscaling), you will need to request a KScope API Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "      Run the following command (replace ```<user_id>``` and ```<password>```) from **within the cluster** to obtain the API Key. The ```access_token``` in the output is your KScope API Key.\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  curl -X POST -d \"grant_type=password\" -d \"username=<user_id>\" -d \"password=<password>\" https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/token\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "2. After obtaining the `.env` configurations, make sure to create the ```.kscope.env``` file in your home directory (```/h/<user_id>```) and set the following env variables:\n",
    "- For local models through Kaleidoscope (KScope):\n",

      "Answer: Based on the provided context, it appears that wheat farmers in Canada are shielded from market downturns by several factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Low concentration of the market**: The wheat farming industry in Canada is characterized by a low concentration of market share, with many small, family-owned farms operating locally. This decentralized structure limits the ability of any single entity to dominate the market and makes it challenging for large corporate farms to consolidate power.\n",
      "2. **Geographical diversity**: Canada's vast and varied geography results in different regions being suited for wheat farming, dispersing production geographically and preventing dominance by a few large players.\n",
      "3. **Regional crop rotation and environmental conditions**: Regional crop rotation and environmental conditions necessitate diverse farming approaches, reducing the likelihood of market concentration.\n",
      "4. **Low buyer power**: Consumers tend to choose the lowest-priced product when all other factors are equal, which puts pressure on wheat farmers to keep prices relatively low. However, this also means that wheat farmers have some flexibility to adjust their prices in response to market conditions.\n",
      "5. **Moderate supplier power**: While upstream suppliers have consolidated, limiting upstream competition, wheat farmers can still negotiate prices with suppliers or switch suppliers to reduce costs.\n",

      "1. Long-distance freight trucking in Canada: The industry has low barriers to entry, making it easy for small-scale businesses and non-employers to enter the market. This has led to the addition of over 5,000 non-employer establishments since 2018, resulting in a low concentration of market share.\n",
