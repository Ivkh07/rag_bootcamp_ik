    "### <u>Requirements</u>\n",
    "1. As you will accessing the LLMs and embedding models through Vector AI Engineering's Kaleidoscope Service (Vector Inference + Autoscaling), you will need to request a KScope API Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Run the following command (replace ```<user_id>``` and ```<password>```) from **within the cluster** to obtain the API Key. The ```access_token``` in the output is your KScope API Key.\n",

    "  curl -X POST -d \"grant_type=password\" -d \"username=<user_id>\" -d \"password=<password>\" https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/token\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "2. After obtaining the `.env` configurations, make sure to create the ```.kscope.env``` file in your home directory (```/h/<user_id>```) and set the following env variables:\n",
    "- For local models through Kaleidoscope (KScope):\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    export OPENAI_BASE_URL=\"https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/v1\"\n",
    "    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<kscope_api_key>\n",

    "- For OpenAI models:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   export OPENAI_BASE_URL=\"https://api.openai.com/v1\"\n",
    "   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai_api_key>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. (Optional) Upload some pdf files into the `source_documents` subfolder under this notebook. We have already provided some sample pdfs, but feel free to replace these with your own."

      "Okay, so I need to figure out how many Vector scholarships in AI were awarded in 2022. I'm not exactly sure where to start, but I know Vector is a company that offers various kinds of scholarships, including AI-related ones. Maybe I can look up their website or some official reports from them. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should check their official website. I remember they have a section for scholarships, so I'll go there. Let me search for Vector scholarships in AI. Hmm, they have a section for AI-related programs, so that's probably where I can find the information. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once I find the scholarship details, I'll need to filter them by the year 2022. I can probably use a search function or go through the list and pick out the ones from that year. But wait, I'm not sure if they have a specific search feature or if I need to manually go through each entry. Maybe they have a table or a list that I can sort by year. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also wonder if Vector has multiple categories of scholarships, like AI, machine learning, etc. So, I should check if there are multiple categories and see if any of them were awarded in 2022. If there are multiple categories, I might need to look into each one separately. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another thought: sometimes scholarships are awarded to multiple students, so I might need to count each individual award. But I'm not sure if Vector does that. Maybe they just list each scholarship individually. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there are any updates or changes in their scholarship programs in 2022. Maybe they announced new scholarships or had some changes in their award criteria. I should check their announcements or news releases for that year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm not sure if Vector has a database of all their scholarship awards. Maybe I can look for any reports or press releases from Vector that mention their AI scholarships for 2022. That might give me a better idea of how many were awarded. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'll start by going to Vector's official website and searching for \"scholarships in AI 2022.\" That should bring up a list of scholarships they offer in that year. Once I have that list, I can go through each one and count how many were awarded. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit worried that I might miss some or count extra ones. Maybe I should also check their annual reports or any press releases from that year for confirmation. That way, I can be sure I'm accurate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if Vector has a website that aggregates all their scholarship information, I can use that to search for 2022. Sometimes websites have a search feature that allows you to filter by year. I'll try that. \n",
      "\n",
      "After I find the list, I'll go through each scholarship, making sure to count only those that are specifically related to AI. If there are multiple categories, I'll have to decide which ones to include. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also wonder if Vector has any partnerships or special programs that might have awarded more scholarships in 2022. Maybe they have a new initiative or a special award that wasn't mentioned before. I should look into that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach could be to check Vector's internal records or any news articles that mention their AI scholarships. Sometimes companies keep internal databases or have articles that detail their award programs. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've covered most of the possible ways to find this information. I'll start by searching their official website, then look for any press releases or reports from 2022, and maybe check their internal records if available. Once I have the list, I'll count the AI-related scholarships to get the accurate number. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should also consider if Vector has any online databases or tools that allow for filtering by year and category. That might make the search process easier. I'll look for any such features on their website. \n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, my plan is:\n",
      "1. Go to Vector's official website.\n",
      "2. Use the search function to find scholarships in AI.\n",
      "3. Filter the results by year 2022.\n",
      "4. Check for any additional information or reports from 2022.\n",
      "5. Count the AI-related scholarships and present the number.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that should cover all the bases. I'll start with the official website search and proceed from there.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine the number of Vector scholarships in AI awarded in 2022, follow this organized approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Access Vector's Official Website**: Visit Vector's official website to locate their scholarship section.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Search for AI-Specific Scholarships**: Use the search function on the website to find scholarships related to AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Filter by Year**: Once the AI scholarships are listed, filter the results to include only those awarded in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Check Press Releases and Reports**: Review any press releases or annual reports from Vector for announcements about 2022 scholarships.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Internal Records Check**: Look into Vector's internal records or any articles that detail their award programs for 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Count AI-Specific Scholarships**: From the filtered list, count the number of scholarships specifically related to AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Consider Additional Features**: Utilize any search features on the website that allow filtering by year and category for easier access.\n",

This variety can provide significant pricing power, which is a key point in the context about consumer power.\n",

It mentions that higher corporate profits can push dealers to upgrade their vehicles to improve efficiency, while weaker profits might limit growth. This suggests that the industry is trying to balance profitability with innovation.\n",
