    "\n",
    "### <u>Requirements</u>\n",
    "1. As you will accessing the LLMs and embedding models through Vector AI Engineering's Kaleidoscope Service (Vector Inference + Autoscaling), you will need to request a KScope API Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Run the following command (replace ```<user_id>``` and ```<password>```) from **within the cluster** to obtain the API Key. The ```access_token``` in the output is your KScope API Key.\n",

    "  curl -X POST -d \"grant_type=password\" -d \"username=<user_id>\" -d \"password=<password>\" https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/token\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "2. After obtaining the `.env` configurations, make sure to create the ```.kscope.env``` file in your home directory (```/h/<user_id>```) and set the following env variables:\n",
    "- For local models through Kaleidoscope (KScope):\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    export OPENAI_BASE_URL=\"https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/v1\"\n",
    "    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<kscope_api_key>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- For OpenAI models:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   export OPENAI_BASE_URL=\"https://api.openai.com/v1\"\n",
    "   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai_api_key>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. (Optional) Upload some pdf files into the `source_documents` subfolder under this notebook. We have already provided some sample pdfs, but feel free to replace these with your own."

      "Okay, so I need to figure out how many Vector scholarships in AI were awarded in 2022. I'm not exactly sure where to start, but I know Vector is a company that offers various kinds of scholarships, including AI-related ones. Maybe I can look up their website or some official reports from them. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should check their official website. I remember they have a section for scholarships, so I'll go there. Let me search for Vector scholarships in AI. Hmm, they have a section for AI-related programs, so that's probably where I can find the information. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once I find the scholarship details, I'll need to filter them by the year 2022. I can probably use a search function or go through the list and pick out the ones from that year. But wait, I'm not sure if they have a specific search feature or if I need to manually go through each entry. Maybe they have a table or a list that I can sort by year. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also wonder if Vector has multiple categories of scholarships, like AI, machine learning, etc. So, I should check if there are multiple categories and see if any of them were awarded in 2022. If there are multiple categories, I might need to look into each one separately. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another thought: sometimes scholarships are awarded to multiple students, so I might need to count each individual award. But I'm not sure if Vector does that. Maybe they just list each scholarship individually. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there are any updates or changes in their scholarship programs in 2022. Maybe they announced new scholarships or had some changes in their award criteria. I should check their announcements or news releases for that year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm not sure if Vector has a database of all their scholarship awards. Maybe I can look for any reports or press releases from Vector that mention their AI scholarships for 2022. That might give me a better idea of how many were awarded. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'll start by going to Vector's official website and searching for \"scholarships in AI 2022.\" That should bring up a list of scholarships they offer in that year. Once I have that list, I can go through each one and count how many were awarded. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm a bit worried that I might miss some or count extra ones. Maybe I should also check their annual reports or any press releases from that year for confirmation. That way, I can be sure I'm accurate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if Vector has a website that aggregates all their scholarship information, I can use that to search for 2022. Sometimes websites have a search feature that allows you to filter by year. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if Vector has any partnerships or programs that might have been announced in 2022 that weren't on their main website. Maybe they have a dedicated page for AI scholarships. I'll check that as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach: I can look for any news articles or press releases from Vector in 2022 that mention AI scholarships. That might give me a direct count. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I'm not sure if Vector has a specific database or if they use external sources. Maybe I can look for any reports or articles from Vector that discuss their AI scholarships. That might help me find the number without having to search the entire website. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'll proceed by going to Vector's official website, searching for \"scholarships in AI 2022,\" and then looking through the results. I'll count each individual scholarship listed, making sure not to double-count or miss any. If I can't find the exact number, I'll try to estimate based on their previous years' award counts. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if Vector has any special programs or categories that might have been awarded in 2022. For example, if they had a specific focus on certain areas of AI, maybe they awarded more scholarships in that category. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, I think the best way is to go to Vector's website, search for the specific year and category, and then count the number of scholarships listed. If I can't find the exact number, I might have to make an educated guess based on their previous years' data or any press releases I can access. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope I don't have to recount any awards, but I'm more worried about missing some. Maybe I'll check a few more times or look for any additional information that could help me confirm the number. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I think the key steps are: go to Vector's website, search for 2022 AI scholarships, count the number, and verify if that's accurate. If I'm unsure, I can look for any additional resources or press releases from that year. \n",
