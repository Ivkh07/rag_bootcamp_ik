    "\n",
    "### <u>Requirements</u>\n",
    "1. As you will accessing the LLMs and embedding models through Vector AI Engineering's Kaleidoscope Service (Vector Inference + Autoscaling), you will need to request a KScope API Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Run the following command (replace ```<user_id>``` and ```<password>```) from **within the cluster** to obtain the API Key. The ```access_token``` in the output is your KScope API Key.\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  curl -X POST -d \"grant_type=password\" -d \"username=<user_id>\" -d \"password=<password>\" https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/token\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "2. After obtaining the `.env` configurations, make sure to create the ```.kscope.env``` file in your home directory (```/h/<user_id>```) and set the following env variables:\n",
    "- For local models through Kaleidoscope (KScope):\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    export OPENAI_BASE_URL=\"https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/v1\"\n",
    "    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<kscope_api_key>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- For OpenAI models:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   export OPENAI_BASE_URL=\"https://api.openai.com/v1\"\n",
    "   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai_api_key>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. (Optional) Upload some pdf files into the `source_documents` subfolder under this notebook. We have already provided some sample pdfs, but feel free to replace these with your own."
