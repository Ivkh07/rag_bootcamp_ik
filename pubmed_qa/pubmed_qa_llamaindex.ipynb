    "# PubMed QA using LlamaIndex\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook presents a RAG workflow for the [PubMed QA](https://pubmedqa.github.io/) task using [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/). The code is written in a configurable fashion, giving you the flexibility to edit the RAG configuration and observe the change in output/responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "It covers a step-by-step procedure for building the RAG workflow (Stages 1-4) and later runs the pipeline on a sample from the dataset. The notebook also covers the sparse, dense, hybrid retrieval strategies along with the re-ranker. We have alse added an optional component for RAG evaluation using the [Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/) library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u>Requirements</u>\n",
    "1. As you will accessing the LLMs and embedding models through Vector AI Engineering's Kaleidoscope Service (Vector Inference + Autoscaling), you will need to request a KScope API Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "      Run the following command (replace ```<user_id>``` and ```<password>```) from **within the cluster** to obtain the API Key. The ```access_token``` in the output is your KScope API Key.\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  curl -X POST -d \"grant_type=password\" -d \"username=<user_id>\" -d \"password=<password>\" https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/token\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "2. After obtaining the `.env` configurations, make sure to create the ```.kscope.env``` file in your home directory (```/h/<user_id>```) and set the following env variables:\n",
    "- For local models through Kaleidoscope (KScope):\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    export OPENAI_BASE_URL=\"https://kscope.vectorinstitute.ai/v1\"\n",
    "    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<kscope_api_key>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- For OpenAI models:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   export OPENAI_BASE_URL=\"https://api.openai.com/v1\"\n",
    "   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai_api_key>\n",

The survey results indicate that the vast majority of responding centers would not transplant a kidney from a cadaveric (88%) or a living donor (91%) into an asymptomatic HIV-infected patient who is otherwise a good candidate for transplantation. However, this does not necessarily mean that all HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease should be excluded from transplantation. The survey results suggest that some centers may consider transplanting an HIV-infected patient, and the authors of the study suggest that the policy of excluding HIV-infected patients from transplantation should be reevaluated. Therefore, the answer to the query is no, as it implies an absolute exclusion, which is not supported by the survey results.\n",
